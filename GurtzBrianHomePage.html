				<h2>About me</h2>
				<div class="about">
					<P>
					I was born in a small town in Indiana, being from a military family we moved to a number of bases. 
					My teen years were spent in Karlsruhe Germany. I keep wanting to say West Germany, because that is what it was while i was living there. 
					I remember when the Berlin Wall came crashing down in 1989. I had a front row seat to a huge milestone in history and was able to witness it first hand. 
					I got to participate in 1989 World Games in Karlsruhe, for skating, and played guitar in a number of bars and clubs chasing the Rock Star dream for a couple of years.
					</P>
					<p>	
					Now I spend as much time as I can with my family and support all the things they like to do. 
					These day's when I have spare time I like to sit and practice various computer languages, just to see what I can make. 
					Professionally I have a number of skills to offer and have vast amounts of experience. 
					I volunteer for non-profit work. In that roll I volunteer my time to assist in writing grants and teaching (what I know) 
					to children that are interested in learning basic computer skills and even some programming. Ruby for Kids for the win.
